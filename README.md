OpenCraft Certificate Manager
=============================

This repository contains a certificate manager based on Certbot, using the Consul key-value store to retrieve its configuration and store the requested certificates.  It is intended to be used together with Ocim [1], the OpenCraft Open edX Instance Manager.
